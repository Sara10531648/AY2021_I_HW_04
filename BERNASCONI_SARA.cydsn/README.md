# SMART LAMP

If the user press b/B the photoresistor starts to be sampled while if the user press s/S sampling is stopped and the lamp turns off.

The potentiometer is sampled only if there is not enough light in the enviroment & the lamp turns on. When it is not sampled the signal goes to -1.

###### Possible improvement

The user can press another button (ex. "a/A") to set a default value of brightness of the lamp, independently on the position of the potentiometer. When the user press "a/A" the photoresistor sampling starts. If light in the enviroment is not enough (according to the threshold) the lamp turns on with the default level of brigthness and the potentiometer sampling is not enabled.
